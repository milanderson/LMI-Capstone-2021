Functional Managers may also advise on resource  management; policies and procedures; collection capabilities and gaps; intelligence processing  and dissemination; technical architectures; and other issues or activities, as applicable.    GEOINT.  The exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe,  assess, and visually depict physical features and geographically referenced activities on the  Earth.  GEOINT consists of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information (section  467 of Reference (a)).  GEOINT collection encompasses all aspects of:  literal, infrared (IR), and  synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery; overhead persistent infrared capabilities; and geospatial  information and services.  The terms imagery intelligence and advanced geospatial intelligence  are encompassed within this definition of GEOINT.  GEOINT includes the exploitation and  analysis of electro-optical, IR, and radar imagery; and of geospatial, spectral, laser, IR,  radiometric, SAR phase history, polarimetric, spatial, and temporal data.  It employs all ancillary  data, signature information, and fused data products, as necessary.  Integrated GEOINT products  may also include data and information from collateral sources.     geospatial information.
