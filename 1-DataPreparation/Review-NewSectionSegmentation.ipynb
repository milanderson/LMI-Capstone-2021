The status of an EwID seed (FMID prefix value) that denotes it has been assigned from  the ESS and either concatenated to generate a 64-bit FMID or redirected to a subsidiary system  to which a query must be forwarded.  This status is used to manage the FMID tracking process at  FMID Tracking Servers.  Whether or not generated FMIDs have been used to tag data for  publication is not part of the term active when applied to an EwID.     ADS.  Defined in Reference (c).    allocation.  The number of EwID seeds that a EwID seed account holder has been authorized to  obtain.  The number of EwID seeds allocated does not reserve specific EwID seed values for  future use, but does guarantee that the number of seeds allocated will be available when  requested.  EwID seed values are specified only when seeds are assigned.    assigned.  A 32-bit EwID seed of a specific value that has been provided to an ESS subscriber  for generation of a full 64-bit FMID, or for redirection to a subordinate end user.    authorization data.

The authoritative source of EwID seeds, on which EwID seed users, or their  intermediaries, must have an account.  The ESS Web site is https://ess.arl.army.mil/.    ESS user account.  A formal relationship that allows one to login to the ESS and utilize its  functions, to include the creation of EwID seed accounts.    EwID.  A scheme to generate unique identifiers that includes a centralized and decentralized  component.  A prefix is provided by a centralized source to ensure enterprise-wide uniqueness,  and a locally controlled suffix extends the procedure to distributed users.  An EwID conveys no  information about the entity it identifies, is a fixed, 64-bit size, and is exchanged as a single  attribute.  Previously termed an Enterprise Identifier or EID, the name was changed to avoid  confusion with an Item Unique Identifier data field with the same acronym that is used to tag  tangible items, such as equipment.
